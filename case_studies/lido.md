# Lido — TVL Quality & Structural Stickiness Assessment

![TVL quality and sustainability metrics](images/tvl_quality_summary.png)

## Snapshot
- Average daily TVL growth: **0.67%**
- TVL volatility: **0.055**
- Maximum drawdown: **−79.5%**
- Peak TVL: **$42.5B** (Aug 2025)
- Current TVL: **$25.7B**
- Current vs peak: **60.4%**
- Observation window: **1835 days**

## Interpretation
Lido demonstrates comparatively low volatility and materially higher retention
relative to peak TVL levels. The absence of a defined half-life reflects ongoing
capital inflows and structural demand for liquid staking.

Unlike DEX-focused protocols, Lido’s TVL is driven by protocol utility rather than
short-term yield incentives.

## Sustainability Takeaway
Lido’s TVL profile suggests **structural capital stickiness**.
TVL durability is supported by Ethereum staking demand and integration depth rather
than emissions or liquidity mining.
