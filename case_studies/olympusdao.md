# Olympus DAO — TVL Collapse & Capital Fragility

![TVL quality and sustainability metrics](images/tvl_quality_summary.png)

## Snapshot
- Average daily TVL growth: **N/A**
- TVL volatility: **N/A**
- Maximum drawdown: **N/A**
- Peak TVL: **$0** (data reflects post-collapse state)
- Current TVL: **$0**
- Observation window: **1740 days**

## Interpretation
Olympus DAO’s TVL metrics are effectively undefined due to near-total capital
withdrawal following the collapse of its bonding and rebase-driven monetary model.

The absence of measurable volatility or drawdown statistics reflects a structural
failure rather than cyclical capital rotation.

## Sustainability Takeaway
Olympus DAO highlights the risks of **reflexive monetary design**.
TVL sustainability cannot be inferred from incentives alone when protocol value
is not anchored to durable demand.
