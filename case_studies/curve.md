# Curve Finance

Curve is a stablecoin-focused DEX optimized for low-slippage swaps.

### TVL Behavior
- Historically large TVL driven by stablecoin liquidity
- Severe drawdowns during broader market deleveraging
- Capital sensitivity to systemic stablecoin risk

### Interpretation
Curve demonstrates how protocol-specific utility can coexist with
high exposure to macro liquidity cycles and stablecoin confidence.
