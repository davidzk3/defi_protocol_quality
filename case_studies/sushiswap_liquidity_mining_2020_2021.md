# SushiSwap — Liquidity Mining Era TVL Assessment

![TVL quality and sustainability metrics](images/tvl_quality_summary.png)

> **TL;DR**  
> SushiSwap is a canonical example of incentive-driven TVL expansion followed by rapid capital decay once emissions subsided.

## Snapshot
- Average daily TVL growth: **0.006%**
- TVL volatility: **0.055**
- Maximum drawdown: **−98.8%**
- Peak TVL: **$7.04B** (Nov 2021)
- Current TVL: **$103M**
- Current vs peak: **1.5%**
- Estimated TVL half-life: **~61 days**
- Observation window: **1906 days**

## Interpretation
SushiSwap’s TVL expansion was strongly correlated with aggressive liquidity mining
incentives during 2020–2021. Growth rapidly decelerated once incentives normalized,
leading to sustained TVL decay.

The short half-life and extreme drawdown indicate that liquidity providers treated
SushiSwap primarily as a yield extraction venue rather than a long-term deployment.

## Sustainability Takeaway
SushiSwap represents a **textbook case of mercenary liquidity**.
Absent sustained incentives or differentiated demand, TVL proved highly transient
and structurally unstable.
