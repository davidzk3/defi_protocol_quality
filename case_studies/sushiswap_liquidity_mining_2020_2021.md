# SushiSwap — Liquidity Mining Era (2020–2021)

SushiSwap experienced explosive growth driven by aggressive liquidity incentives.

### TVL Behavior
- Rapid TVL expansion during high emissions
- Severe drawdowns following incentive tapering
- Weak long-term capital retention

### Interpretation
SushiSwap serves as a canonical example of incentive-driven liquidity
that fails to persist once rewards normalize.
