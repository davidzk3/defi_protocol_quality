![TVL quality and sustainability metrics](images/tvl_quality_summary.png)

## Snapshot
- Average daily TVL growth: **0.41%**
- TVL volatility: **0.036**
- Maximum drawdown: **−50.4%**
- Peak TVL: **$615M** (Aug 2025)
- Current TVL: **$381M**
- Current vs peak: **61.9%**
- Observation window: **873 days**

## Interpretation
GMX V2 exhibits relatively low volatility and moderate drawdowns compared to
liquidity-driven DeFi protocols. Capital appears more persistent due to the role
of liquidity providers in supporting perpetual trading rather than pure yield
extraction.

The shorter observation window reflects GMX V2’s relative maturity stage.

## Sustainability Takeaway
GMX’s TVL profile suggests **utility-aligned liquidity**, with capital durability
linked to sustained trading activity rather than emissions-driven incentives.
