# Methodology

Protocols are evaluated using time-series TVL metrics rather than raw TVL rankings.

Key metrics include:
- Average daily growth
- TVL volatility
- Maximum drawdown
- Capital retention vs historical peak
- TVL half-life

The objective is to assess the durability and sustainability of protocol TVL.
